# Terrain Generator Framework

**Warning!** This is very much a work in progress. At the moment, this
exists mostly as a reference that others can use for their own code,
rather than as a production ready terrain generator in its own right.

A terrain generator framework for Roblox intended to be, in rough order:

1. Very fast.
2. Target smooth terrain, but support bloxel Part terrain as well.
3. Be highly customizable where it matters, flexible to whatever a
   developer needs.
4. Usable either for pre-generating terrain for a game (via a plugin),
   or for real time generation client-side.
